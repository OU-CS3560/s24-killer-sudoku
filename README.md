## About this project

Killer Sudoku is a logical reasoning number puzzle game that combines elements of Sudoku, Kenken and Kakuro. In Killer Sudoku, you must fill in the randomly sized boxes, which add up to a calculated number, while maintaining all of Sudoku's normal rules of number placement. Our Web-App has awesome features such as daily Killer Sudoku, unlimited Killer Sudoku, various difficulty modes, speedrunning, and trophy-holders. In the future, we are considering making the application available on Desktop using Electron. 

## Platform

Our application utilizes the typical Javascript back-end and CSS front-end. Additionally, we are hosting a linode server for all students to try our Sudoku.

## Frameworks/Tools

This application will be using Next.js for the React component, and applying Tailwind CSS.

## How to build/compile

Go to the posted team-killer-sudoku website and try it out! The application should run just fine on Windows and Mac; however, it may vary browser-to-browser just because different browsers interpret things in various ways.
